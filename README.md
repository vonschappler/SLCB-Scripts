# SLCB-Scripts

## Introduction:

In this repository, it's possible to find all the Python Scripts I have made for **Streamlabs Chatbot**.

Some of those scripts were made by request while others were created (initally) for personal use. I decided to share those scripts to show off my work.

Note that commisioned/paid scripts are not listed here, so if you have interest in a particular script, feel free to [contact me](mailto:vonschappler_dev@outlook.com)! Be asured that your script will not be added to this repository!

Feel free to make use of those if you want.

In order to use the scripts, refer the official [**Streamlabs Chatbot** documentation](https://cdn.streamlabs.com/chatbot/Documentation_Twitch.pdf).

## List of Scripts:

The scripts listed here are sorted alphabetically and their links refer to the last wroking version released.
