# SLCB-Scripts

## Introduction:

In this repository, it's possible to find all the Python Scripts I have made for **Streamlabs Chatbot**.

Some of those scripts were made by request, others created (initally) for personal use.

Feel free to make use of those if you want.

In order to use the scripts, refer the official [**Streamlabs Chatbot** documentation](https://cdn.streamlabs.com/chatbot/Documentation_Twitch.pdf).

## List of Scripts:

The scripts listed here are sorted alphabetically and their links refer to the last wroking version released.
